# End-to-End Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the **Global Superstore dataset** through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
The goal was to practice the full workflow of a data analyst: from raw data to insights.  

##  Tools Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Excel**: For quick inspection and cleaning  

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
   - Standardized column names for consistency  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed sales, profit, and discount trends  
   - Explored patterns across regions, categories, and customers  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Built multiple charts to tell the story:  
     - Bar charts  
     - Line charts  
     - Pie chart  
     - Scatter plot  
     - Heatmap  
     - Boxplot  

## Key Insights
- Certain product categories drive sales but yield low profit margins.  
- Regional differences in shipping costs affect profitability.  
- Discounts donâ€™t always lead to higher profits.  

## What I Learned
- Data cleaning and preparation in Python  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Creating clear and meaningful visualizations  
- Writing structured project summaries  

## About This Project
This was my first **end-to-end project**, helping me build confidence in data analysis.  
It showcases my ability to work with raw data, extract insights, and communicate findings visually.
